                at the final in Portugal's capital, Lisbon.A goal by
                French winger Kingsley Coman was enough for the 
                Munich side on Sunday to dash the Parisians' dreams 
                of winning for the first time the top club competition
                of European football.The Paris-born Coman, a former

                The final was played behind closed doors due to the
