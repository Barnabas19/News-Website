                We're a few months away from the launch of the 2020 
                iPhones, which are expected in September or October 
                2020, but there are already dozens of rumors about the 
                upcoming devices. We're expecting the 2020 iPhones to be
                called the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro if Apple follows
                the same naming scheme it used for the 2019 iPhone lineup.
                The 2020 iPhones will feature major updates, 
                introducing some of the first design changes that
                we've seen since the iPhone X was released in 2017. 
                We're expecting four iPhones in three display sizes
                which could come in at 5.4, 6.7, and 6.1 inches (x2).
